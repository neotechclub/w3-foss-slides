# **Our Journey & Timeline**
A brief, emotionally-charged, and probably-not-to-scale history of us.
- **[Jan 2025]**: The "Wouldn't it be cool if..." moment. 
- **[March 2025]**: Met up with Het Joshi and the Mukti team and planned something out.
- **[April 2025]**: First chaotic planning session.<sub>(lots of procrastination)</sub>
- **Today**: Launch Day! You're all here!
- **The Future**: Workshops, projects, and maybe world domination? (The ethical kind, of course.)

# **Why Do This? Is There a Need?**

Tech can be intimidating. We're here to change that.


This club exists to create a space where questions are encouraged, collaboration is key, and you don't have to be a "guru" to participate. 


# We're building a community, not just a portfolio!

# **"But I'm Not a Programmer!"**

...and that is perfectly fine. Seriously.

Tech is more than just code. It's design, ethics, project management, and a million other things.

A project needs many things not related to programming!

Take me for example: I can get a simpler server running maintain repos and deploy apps, but my web dev skills are... terrible. 

My tiny web portfolio is a testament to what's possible when you collaborate: with people and with tools.

# **Questions, Suggestions, Feedback?**

The floor is yours.

What do you want to see? 

What are you excited about? What's your favorite pizza topping and why is it not pineapple?

Let's talk.
