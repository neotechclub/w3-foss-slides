--- 

# **About Me**
--- 
## **This Presentation was made completely with MarkDown thanks to Marp!**

<!--We will cover the basics like what are there, how it works(quick overview, quick technical breakdown, story of pixelpulse2, further explanation on how it works, soarpkgs, how to get it merged)-->

<!-- Why this, why not that? First for AppImages, then sharun, then soar -->
<!-- Live preview if possible of Pixelpulse2 -->

<!-- porting of an App, from idea, research, adapting an old package to new setup -->

# **Topics Covered**
- Why is any of this needed?
- AppImages - What, how and why?
- Sharun and lib4bin
- A tale of Pixelpulse2 and student frustrations
- Compatibility with other Linux Distributions

# **AppImages and their History: probonopd**
- Also made go-appimage which can be used to make static binaries, though we'll take a slightly different approach
- Also responsible for type2-runtime which normal AppImages use to execute the App Binaries, though we'll take a slightly different approach again
