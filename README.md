# **So, You Got a New Device...**
## But do you really *own* it?

<sub>Let's talk about the code that runs our lives.</sub>

---

# **Who Are We, Again?**

We're **NeoTech Club**! We're the first batch, which means we're all figuring this out together. It's a journey, and we're glad you're on it with us.

--- 

Thankfully, we're not totally on our own. We're part of **Mukti**, a larger community dedicated to FOSS, that helps guide us. Think of them as the wise mentors in our origin story.

# **The Unseen Listeners** ðŸ‘‚
Ever talked about something, only to see an ad for it moments later? Spooky, right?

Your devices, apps, and services are constantly collecting data. Your clicks, your location, your conversations... it's all product. You're not the customer; you're the product being sold.

We're here to show you how to take back control ðŸ“²

# **The Hero: FOSS**

**FOSS** stands for **Free and Open-Source Software**.
- **Free** as in *freedom*, not just free of cost. You have the freedom to see, change, and share the code.
- **Open-Source** means the code is public. Anyone can check it for sneaky trackers or security flaws.

--- 

Itâ€™s about **transparency** and **community**, not corporate secrets.

---

### **FOSS is Already Everywhere!**
You're using it right now, you just might not know itðŸ˜‰

- The **Android** on your phone? Based on Open-Source AOSP and the Linux Kernel.
- The **servers** that power the internet? Almost all of them are running Open-Source Linux Distros.
- Your **smartwatch**? Probably running some version of Android Wear or Linux too!
###### It's the invisible backbone of the modern tech world.

# **Let's Make a Change**

Ready to swap out some of those data-hungry apps for privacy-respecting alternatives?

Here are a few easy switches.

---

## **App Stores: The Gateway**

<div class="side-by-side">
<div>

### Google Play Store
- Tracks you
- Full of ads
- Proprietary

</div>
<div>

#### F-Droid/IzzyOnDroid
- No tracking or ads, transparent disclosure
- Only Open-Source apps

# **Let's Talk Privacy**

Privacy isn't about having something to hide. It's about having something to protect.

### **Why This Matters: A Story**
##### George Orwell's *1984*

<div style="font-size: medium;">

- ***Total Control:*** A government led by "Big Brother" watches everyone. Independent thought is the ultimate crime.
- ***Secret Rebellion:*** One man dares to think for himself and falls in love, defying the system in small ways.
- ***Individuality Crushed:*** The Party captures him, breaks his spirit, and forces him to love his oppressor.

### **Privacy vs. Security vs. Anonymity**
They are not the same thing!
###### <sub>Snippets from PrivacyGuides.org</sub>

> <sup>**Privacy**</sup> is the assurance that your data is only seen by the parties you intend to view it.

> <sup>**Security**</sup> is the ability to trust the applications you use.

> <sup>**Anonymity**</sup> is the ability to act without a persistent identifier.

# **What You Can Do... Right Now!**

**Scan the QR to download 
F-Droid.**

## **2. Secure Your Accounts: Aegis**
Ditch Google Authenticator. **Aegis** is an open-source 2FA app that lets you back up your codes, lock the app with a password, and gives you full control. Find it on F-Droid!

## **3. Ditch Google Apps: Fossify**
Phone, calendar, files, gallery... **Fossify** offers a complete suite of simple, ad-free, open-source apps to replace the default ones<sub>that do not send data private back!</sub>

---

## **4. Scan Docs Without Scanners**
Need to scan a document? Don't use CamScanner. Use **Open Source Document Scanner**. No ads, no watermarks, no selling your data.
You can install it directly from 
F-Droid<sup>(through izzyondroid)</sup>
