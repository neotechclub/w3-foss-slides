# **The Elephant in the Room: Why?**
New users want something that "just works" across any distro they install, be it Ubuntu, Debian, PopOS, Arch, or even Alpine Linux

<!-- You can use this to quickly install and run static apps on any linux distro -->

<!--This is comparable to Homebrew-->

<!--Fumbling with solutions is not a good look, neither are huge installs -->
<!-- Users load linux to escape bloat, not cause them -->

Eg. Flatpak vs AppImage:
